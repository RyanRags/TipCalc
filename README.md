# TipCalc

First Project on new GitHub Account. The last one was connected to my school email that I could no longer access.
This is a tip calulating app that does the math for you.
The design and IU is very simple, but really intresting. The updates occur live as you change the tip amounts and the tip percent which uses a slide bar.
There is also text showing how good the tip you are giving is/how the service was. As the tip percentage is changed so does the words.
